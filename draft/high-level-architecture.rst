Abstract
========

When Celery was conceived, production environments were radically different from today.

Nowadays most applications are (or should be):

* Deployed to a cloud provider's computing resources.
* Distributed (sometimes between data centers).
* Available or Consistent (We must pick one according to :term:`CAP Theorem`).
* Network Partition Tolerant.
* Observable.
* Built with scalability in mind.
* Cloud Native - The application's lifecycle is managed using Kubernetes, Swarm, or any other scheduler.

Also, Celery lacks proper support for large scale deployments and some useful messaging architectural patterns.

Celery 5 is the next major version of Celery, and so we can break backward compatibility, even in significant ways.

As such, our next major version should represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the way we implement our task execution platform.
Future major versions will drastically change how Celery works.

This document provides a high-level overview of the new architecture for the next generation of Celery
major versions.
